# Basket Case

Basket Case is a fun, whimsical app that returns a set of gift suggestions based
on a user-selected budget.

Created by: [Davis Green](https://github.com/Mahartney/), [Negar Kalbasi](https://github.com/noonkay), and [Peter Zhang](https://github.com/pzhang87).

## Approach

Basket Case was written in Javascript and uses the node-apac Client to query the
Amazon Product Advertising API. It is intended as a single-page application, though
not all features have been implemented to make it so.
